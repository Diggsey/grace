//! Portable library for intercepting various kinds of shutdown signal,
//! allowing your application to shutdown gracefully.
//!
//! Windows does not have signals (although they are emulated to some
//! extent by `libc`) so this crate uses the appropriate windows API
//! functions directly to respond to interrupt and shutdown requests.
//!
//! On other platforms signals are used via the `signal-stack`
//! crate.
